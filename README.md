# Playing the game

When it's your turn, enter the valid coordinates to place a 3x3 attack on the opponent's grid. If any of its ships are hit, then they will be revealed to you.

When it's the computer's turn, it will randomly generate its attack on your grid.

# Winning the game

The game ends when all the ships on either side are hit.

If you manage to sink all of the opponent's ships, then you win! Congratulations.

If the opponent manages to sink all of your ships, then they win. Better luck next time.
